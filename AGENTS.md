# AI Agent Quickstart (Kiro Workflow)

Use this file as a **thin router**. Read steering before coding; specs live under `.kiro/specs/`.

## Read steering first

- [**Product vision**](.kiro/steering/product.md) — client-compute NLE for mid-tier creators; performance is the product.
- [**Architecture**](.kiro/steering/architecture.md) — accelerated pipeline, capability tiers, compatibility paths, development phases.
- [**Technical constraints**](.kiro/steering/tech.md) — SolidJS + Vite, Mediabunny, WebGPU/WebCodecs, Cloudflare static PWA.
- [**Repository structure**](.kiro/steering/structure.md) — `src/ui/` vs `src/engine/`, naming, layout.
- [**UI standards**](.kiro/steering/ui-standards.md) — dark professional-tool aesthetic, bespoke timeline.
- [**Code style**](.kiro/steering/style.md) — TypeScript strict conventions, SolidJS patterns, naming, CSS.
- [**Testing standards**](.kiro/steering/testing.md) — Vitest scope, mocking strategy, quality gate.
- [**Accessibility**](.kiro/steering/accessibility.md) — ARIA patterns, keyboard nav, contrast, focus management.
- [**Security**](.kiro/steering/security.md) — COOP/COEP, file handling, no secrets, user data policy.
- [**Review policy**](.kiro/steering/review.md) — Kiro/Claude review process + output format (`#review`); priorities live in [Review guidelines](#review-guidelines) below.

## Workspace MCP config

[`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`](.kiro/settings/mcp.json) — workspace MCP server configuration.

## Skills

Reusable packs in [`.kiro/skills/`](.kiro/skills/):

- **web-design-guidelines** — Web Interface Guidelines compliance checker.
- **solid-patterns** — SolidJS reactivity and main-thread UI conventions for this project.

## Specs (`.kiro/specs/`)

Each spec has `design.md`, `requirements.md`, and `tasks.md` (bugfix specs use `bugfix.md` instead of `requirements.md`).

**Active:**

## Useful commands

```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run dev    # Vite dev server (COOP/COEP headers enabled)
npm run build  # Typecheck + production build
npm run preview
npm test       # Vitest
```

## Architectural boundaries (hard gates)

1. **Main thread stays interactive** — no sustained decode/GPU/encode/mux/pixel loops on main. Bounded probes and labeled compatibility helpers are allowed when measured.
2. **Accelerated path has no CPU pixel round-trips** — `VideoFrame` → `importExternalTexture` → compute chain → encoder stays zero-copy. Compatibility paths may be slower only when separate, explicit, and visibly labeled.
3. **`SharedArrayBuffer` is the premium clock** — high-frequency accelerated playback uses SAB. If `crossOriginIsolated !== true`, keep the shell alive and show a limited capability tier instead of a dead-end fatal screen.
4. **Single WebGPU command submission per frame** for the accelerated effect chain (Phase 4+).
5. **Client-compute core editing** — import/edit/preview/effects/audio/export must run in the user's browser. Cloudflare is for static hosting and COOP/COEP headers, not server-side media processing.
6. **npm only** — `package-lock.json` is the lockfile; no `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lock`.

## Quality gate

1. `npm run build` → succeeds (strict TypeScript).
2. `npm test` → green; test count must not decrease for non-trivial logic changes.
3. Full-performance dev and production must keep COOP/COEP so `crossOriginIsolated === true`; missing isolation must show the limited capability tier rather than crashing the shell.
4. Every `VideoFrame` `.close()`d exactly once in engine code paths.

## Review guidelines

These guidelines drive **Codex** PR reviews (`@codex review`, or automatic reviews) and apply to every other review agent too. Codex reads this section per the [GitHub integration docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/integrations/github), applying the closest `AGENTS.md` to each changed file. **This section is the single source of truth for review priorities** — the Kiro/Claude review process and output format live in [`.kiro/steering/review.md`](.kiro/steering/review.md), which extends (never restates) this checklist.

**Match the depth of Claude's [code-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/code-review/README.md) and [pr-review-toolkit](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/pr-review-toolkit/README.md) plugins.** Do **not** stop after one or two findings: review every changed file in full and run all the lenses below before concluding.

### Method (mirror Claude's multi-agent review)

1. Read **all** changed files end to end — never just the diff hunks.
2. Run each lens as an independent pass: guideline compliance, bug detection, resource/lifetime, error handling, tests, type design, comment accuracy, simplification.
3. Trace consumers when a `postMessage` protocol or `SharedArrayBuffer` layout changes; verify CSS selectors match the actual SolidJS DOM.
4. Report one finding per concrete issue with `file:line`, the impact, and a concrete fix — not a vague summary.

### Priorities (GitHub surfaces only P0 and P1 — classify accordingly)

**P0 — blocks merge (architectural hard-gate violations):**

- Sustained media decode/encode/GPU/pixel processing on the main thread without an explicit measured compatibility-tier design.
- `getImageData`, Canvas2D readback, or CPU pixel round-trip in the accelerated preview/export hot path.
- Per-frame `postMessage` for the accelerated playback clock when `SharedArrayBuffer` is available.
- Missing COOP/COEP headers for the full-performance build, or missing user-facing capability handling when `crossOriginIsolated` is false.
- Server runtime, external API calls, telemetry, cloud storage, or paid server compute required for core editing/export.
- `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lock` added (npm only).
- A `VideoFrame` not `.close()`d, or closed twice.
- Logic bugs, crashes, data loss, race conditions, or security issues introduced by the change.

**P1 — should fix this cycle:**

- Multiple `queue.submit` per frame for the accelerated effect chain (Phase 4+).
- `importExternalTexture` cached across frames.
- Unbounded frame queues without `encodeQueueSize` backpressure; frame cache without LRU + `.close()` on eviction.
- Accelerated effect chain run twice for preview vs export instead of sharing one processed texture.
- Media objects or WebGPU handles leaking into `src/ui/`; missing `onCleanup` for rAF/listeners.
- Unstable references causing unnecessary re-renders in the rAF clock loop.
- Silent failures: swallowed errors, empty catch blocks, missing handling on critical paths.
- Missing tests for timeline model, seek logic, or protocol types on non-trivial changes; tests that mock away the invariant under test.
- Inaccurate/outdated comments, weak types that fail to encode invariants, and dead code.

Be thorough but not noisy: surface every P0/P1 you can substantiate, and skip pedantic nits, pre-existing issues the PR didn't touch, and anything a linter already catches.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **COOP/COEP** are load-bearing: `public/_headers` and `vite.config.ts` `server.headers` / `preview.headers`.
- **WebGPU + WebCodecs** require a modern Chromium browser for full performance; engine code runs in the pipeline worker, not on main.
- **Preview shortcuts must be capability-tiered** — do not regress the worker WebGPU path. If adding Canvas/WebGL/CPU fallback preview, keep it separate, reduced capability, and visibly labeled.
- **Single dev process** — no backend, media server, database, Docker, or `.env` secrets. Only `npm run dev` (port **5173**) is required for interactive work; the pipeline worker is spawned automatically by the UI.
- **Remote browser access** — when testing via the Desktop pane, start Vite with `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` so Chrome can reach the server.
- **Quality gate in CI-like runs** — there is no separate lint script; use `npm run build` (strict `tsc` + Vite) and `npm test` (Vitest, Node environment).
- **Manual E2E smoke test** — open Chromium to `http://localhost:5173` (or the server's remote URL when using `--host 0.0.0.0`), confirm the status bar shows the accelerated/COOP-COEP OK tier, click **Import**, and load a local MP4/MOV/WebM. Also verify a non-isolated/missing-capability run shows limited mode instead of a blank app. A tiny test clip can be generated with `ffmpeg` if none is checked in.
- **WebGPU in cloud VMs** — headless or software-rendered environments may report “No WebGPU adapter”; metadata import and the SAB clock still work. Full zero-copy preview requires hardware WebGPU.
